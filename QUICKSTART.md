## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up AI Integration (Required)

To enable AI-powered recommendations, you need a Google Gemini API key:

1. **Get API Key**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key (it's free!)

2. **Add API Key**:
   - Open `src/services/aiService.ts`
   - Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
   ```typescript
   const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key_here';
   ```

### 2. Run the App

The app is already running! You can:

**📱 On Mobile Device:**
- Install "Expo Go" app on your phone
- Scan the QR code in the terminal

**💻 On Web Browser:**
- Press `w` in the terminal to open in browser

**🤖 On Android Emulator:**
- Press `a` in the terminal (requires Android Studio)

## 🧪 Test the App

### Without AI (Works Immediately):
- Browse product categories
- View product details
- Search uses fallback keyword matching

### With AI (After adding API key):
- Natural language search: "lightweight laptop for travel"
- Smart recommendations with explanations
- AI-powered product matching

## 📱 App Features

### 🏠 Home Screen
- Welcome interface
- Product categories
- Quick search examples
- Feature explanations

### 🔍 Search Screen
- Natural language input
- AI-powered recommendations
- Fallback keyword search
- Loading states & error handling

### 📋 Product Details
- Comprehensive product info
- Specifications & features
- Pricing & ratings

## 🎯 Example Searches

Try these natural language queries:

- "I need a lightweight laptop for travel with long battery life"
- "Gaming headphones under $500 with noise cancellation"
- "Professional camera for photography"
- "Budget smartphone with great camera"
- "Smart TV for my living room with 4K"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No recommendations found"**
   - Check if API key is set correctly
   - Try more general search terms
   - App will use fallback keyword matching

2. **App won't start**
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory
   - Run `npm install` again
   - Clear cache: `expo start -c`

3. **API errors**
   - Verify API key is valid
   - Check internet connection
   - App gracefully falls back to keyword search
